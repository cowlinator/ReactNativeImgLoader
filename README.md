Hi there!

ImgLoader is a simple app written with React Native, which allows you to view any online image resource given its URL.
Simply type in the URL of the image, and tap "Load Image".  The image will appear on your screen.

This project took aproximately 3-4 hours, after I had installed react-native on my home system.
Having never worked with react, react-native, nor JSX, most of the time was spent searching through the react-native API documentation.

Given more time, I would also have liked to have researched the API and best practices of react and react-native.  I am passionate about doing things the right way, and struggling through a new language has given me clear indications that there are safer and more efficient ways to do what I've done. 
Since I like to make unique tools that are useful to me (and possibly others), I would probably have created an app that could display today's comic from all of my favorite online comic strips.

This project has been a lot of fun, and I was excited to expand my knowlege base.  I'm now eager to use react-native in future projects.  Much more so than before my exposure.
